In the VertexPositionNormalTextureHue structure, the Hue attribute is interpreted:

If Hue.y == 0, do not hue.
If Hue.y == 1, hue the entire sprite with index == Hue.x
If Hue.y == 2, hue only the grayscale pixels of the sprite with index == Hue.x

Hue.z is the transparency of the sprite. 0 == opaque, 1 == completely transparent.
