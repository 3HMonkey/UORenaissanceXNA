UltimaXNA includes a VERY limited HTML parser and layout engine. This parser
does not conform to standard HTML practices, but rather implements the subset
of HTML implemented by the legacy UO client. In addition, I've added some tags
to help prettify text and layout, but these are VERY basic. For better or worse,
the parser will ignore almost anything that it doesn't understand.

HtmlGumpling controls support a very limited subset of Html tags:

<b>

<i>

<u>

<outline>

<big>

<basefont> / <medium>

<small>

<left>

<center>

<right>

<a>
    supported attribute: href

<gumpimg>
    supported attributes: src, hoversrc, activesrc, width, height

<itemimg>
    
<span>
    attributes: width, height
    
All tags support the color, hovercolor, and activecolor attributes. However,
note that ASCII fonts do not support coloring with these attributes.

In addition, a very limited subset of CSS is supported using the "style=''"
attribute:
    "font-family: ascii[0-9] / uni[0-2];"
    "text-decoration: none / underline;"
    "top/left: 5;" sets the initial position of this element. Kinda like margin.
    "layer: background;" takes the element out of the layout engine.

Ideally, the HTML renderer, which is very limited at the moment, will lay out
things in a new (but still limited) box model. In this model, there will be
content tags and box tags. Box tags will effect layout; content tags will be
moved inside the boxes.
