**UORenaissanceXNA: Open Source Ultima Online Client in C#/XNA**

UORenaissanceXNA is an advanced client for the massive multiplayer online roleplay game Ultima Online. It is a further development of the original [UltimaXNA project](https://github.com/ZaneDubya/UltimaXNA/), which was started back in the year 2006.
The target is to create a fully advanced UO-client which refreshes rendering techniques without losing the original feeling of classic 2D-clients.
