Getting started
-----------
It is suggested that you use [Visual Studio 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx) to develop and run UltimaXNA. You will also need to install [XNA for Visual Studio 2013](https://msxna.codeplex.com/releases/view/117230).

UltimaXNA does not include the Ultima Online resource files, maps, and art, and thus will not work on a computer that does not have Ultima Online installed. UltimaXNA is compatible with any Ultima Online client prior to the introduction of the *.UOP resource format, including Mondain's Legacy. [Download the client files for Mondain's Legacy here](http://games.mirrors.tds.net/pub/ea-games/uo/uoml_setup.exe).

UltimaXNA is designed to work with all server software. The reccomended installation is RunUO 2.3, [which you can download here](https://code.google.com/p/runuo/downloads/list).
