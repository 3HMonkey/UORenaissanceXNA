UltimaXNA is an isometric massively multiplayer online role playing client that supports playing Ultima Online on your favorite freeshards! The client is already playable, but not all features are implemented. We are currently working on [Milestone 0.8](https://github.com/ZaneDubya/UltimaXNA/milestones), which focuses on bugfixes and adding features not used in daily play.

**Getting started**

You should use [Visual Studio 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx) to develop and compile UltimaXNA. You will also need to install [XNA for Visual Studio 2013](https://msxna.codeplex.com/releases/view/117230).

UltimaXNA does not include the Ultima Online resource files, and will not work on a computer that does not have Ultima Online installed. UltimaXNA is compatible with any Ultima Online client prior to the introduction of the UOP resource format, including Mondain's Legacy. [Download the client files for Mondain's Legacy here](http://games.mirrors.tds.net/pub/ea-games/uo/uoml_setup.exe).

UltimaXNA is designed to work with all server software. The recommended installation is RunUO 2.3, [which you can download here](https://code.google.com/p/runuo/downloads/list).
