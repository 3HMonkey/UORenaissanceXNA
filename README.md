UltimaXNA is an isometric massively multiplayer online role playing game client. It is programmed in C# and uses the XNA framework for graphics and audio. In its default configuration, UltimaXNA uses the data from any Ultima Online installation released prior to the introduction of the new *.UOP format. In tandem with the RunUO server, the client provides a framework for MMORPG video game development. 

UltimaXNA is programmed in large part by Zane Wagner and Jeff Boulanger.

At this time the project is functional but nowhere near feature complete.
